## OOP

- abstract class / method :
  abstract method is a method which only has declaration and doesn't have definition.

- a class is called abstract class only if it has at least one abstract method.

- when you inherit a abstract class as a parent to the child class, the child class should define all the abstract method present in parent class.
- if it is not done then child class also becomes abstract class automatically.
  at last, python by default doesn't support abstract class and abstract method, so there is a package called ABC(abstract base classes) by which we can make a class or method abstract.

## web services:

- web services include any software, application, or cloud technology that provides standardized web protocols (HTTP or HTTPS) to interoperate, communicate, and exchange data messaging – usually XML (Extensible Markup Language) – throughout the internet.

- web services are XML-centered data exchange systems that use the internet for A2A (application-to-application) communication and interfacing. These processes involve programs, messages, documents, and/or objects.

## Types of Web Services?

- XML-RPC (Remote Procedure Call) is the most basic XML protocol to exchange data between a wide variety of devices on a network. It uses HTTP to quickly and easily transfer data and communication other information from client to server.

- UDDI (Universal Description, Discovery, and Integration) is an XML-based standard for detailing, publishing, and discovering web services. It’s basically an internet registry for businesses around the world. The goal is to streamline digital transactions and e-commerce among company systems.

- SOAP, is an XML-based Web service protocol to exchange data and documents over HTTP or SMTP (Simple Mail Transfer Protocol). It allows independent processes operating on disparate systems to communicate using XML.

- REST, provides communication and connectivity between devices and the internet for API-based tasks. Most RESTful services use HTTP as the supporting protocol.
